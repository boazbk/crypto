# An Intensive Introduction to Cryptography

__Boaz Barak__

_Work in progress_

These are lecture notes for an introductory but fast-paced undergraduate/beginning graduate course on cryptography.
I am using these notes for [Harvard CS 127](https://cs127.boazbarak.org).


You can also download [all lecture notes in a single PDF file](https://files.boazbarak.org/crypto/lnotes_book.pdf).


If you have any comments, suggestions, typo fixes, etc.. I would be very grateful if you post them as an [issue](https://github.com/boazbk/crypto/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/boazbk/crypto/pulls) in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boazbk/crypto) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.
