# Pseudorandomness



__Reading:__ Katz-Lindell Section 3.3, Boneh-Shoup Chapter 3


The nature of randomness has troubled philosophers, scientists, statisticians
and laypeople for many years.[^abc] Over the years people have given different
answers to the question of what does it mean for data to be random, and what is
the nature of probability. The movements of the planets initially looked random
and arbitrary, but then the early astronomers managed to find *order* and make
some *predictions* on them. Similarly we have made great advances in predicting
the weather, and probably will continue to do so.
So, while these days it seems as if the event of whether or not it will rain a week from today
is *random*, we could imagine that in with time we will be able to predict the weather further into the future.
Even the canonical notion of a random experiment -tossing a coin -
turns out that it [might not be as random as you'd think](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf), with about a
51% chance that the second toss will have the same result as the first one.
(Though [see also this experiment](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/coin_tosses.html).)
It is conceivable that at some point someone would discover some function $F$
that given the first 100 coin tosses by any given person can predict the value of the
101$^{th}$.[^def]
In all these examples, the physics underlying the event, whether it's the
planets' movement, the weather, or coin tosses, did not change but only
our powers to predict them.
So to a large extent, *randomness is a function of
the observer*, or in other words

[^abc]: Even lawyers grapple with this question, with a recent example being the debate of whether fantasy football is a game of chance or of skill.

[^def]: In fact such a function must exist in some sense since in the entire history of the world, presumably no sequence of $100$ fair coin tosses has ever repeated.

>   *If a quantity is hard to compute, it might as well be random.*

Much of cryptography is about trying to make this intuition more formal, and
harnessing it to build secure systems. The basic object we want is the
following:

> # {.definition title="Pseudorandom generator" #prgdef}
A function $G:{\{0,1\}}^n\rightarrow{\{0,1\}}^\ell$  is a $(T,\epsilon)$ *pseudorandom generator* if  $G(U_n) \approx_{T,\epsilon} U_\ell$ where $U_t$ denotes the uniform
distribution on ${\{0,1\}}^t$.
>
We say that $G:\{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$ is a _pseudorandom generator_ with length function $\ell:\N \rightarrow \N$ (where $\ell(n)>n$) if $G$ is computable in polynomial time, and there are functions $T(n)>n^{\omega(1)}$ and $\epsilon(n)<n^{-\omega(1)}$ such that
$$G(U_n) \approx_{T(n),\epsilon(n)} U_{\ell(n)} \label{prgdefeq}$$
for every $n\in \N$.

> # { .pause }
This definition (as is often the case in cryptography) is a bit long, so you want to take your time parsing it. In particular you should verify that you understand why the condition [prgdefeq](){.eqref} is the same as saying that for every polynomial $p:\N \rightarrow \N$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then for every circuit $D$ of at most $T$ gates (or equivalently, for every straightline program $D$ of at most $T$ lines):
$$\left| \Pr[D(G(U_n))=1] - \Pr[ D(U_\ell)=1] \right| < \tfrac{1}{p(n)} \label{prgdefeq}$$


Note that the requirement that $\ell>n$ is crucial to make this notion
non-trivial, as for $\ell=n$ the function $G(x)=x$ clearly satisfies that
$G(U_n)$ is identical to (and hence in particular indistinguishable from) the distribution
$U_n$.
(Make sure that you understand this last statement!)
However, for $\ell>n$ this is no longer trivial at all, and in particular if we didn't
restrict the running time of $Eve$ then no such pseudo-random generator would
exist:

> # {.lemma #breakprglem}
Suppose that $G:{\{0,1\}}^n\rightarrow{\{0,1\}}^{n+1}$. Then there
exists an (inefficient) algorithm $Eve:{\{0,1\}}^{n+1}\rightarrow{\{0,1\}}$ such
that ${\mathbb{E}}[ Eve(G(U_n)) ]=1$ but ${\mathbb{E}}[ Eve(U_{n+1})] \leq 1/2$.

> # {.proof data-ref="breakprglem"}
On input $y\in{\{0,1\}}^{n+1}$, consider the algorithm $Eve$ that goes over all possible
$x\in{\{0,1\}}^n$ and will output $1$ if and only if $y=G(x)$ for some $x$.
Clearly ${\mathbb{E}}[ Eve(G(U_n)) ] =1$.
However, the set $S =\{ G(x) : x\in {\{0,1\}}^n \}$ on which Eve outputs $1$ has size at most $2^n$, and hence a
random $y{\leftarrow_{\tiny R}} U_{n+1}$ will fall in $S$ with probability at most
$1/2$.

It is not hard to show that if $P=NP$ then the above algorithm Eve can be made
efficient.
In particular, at the moment we do not know how to *prove*
the existence of pseudorandom generators. Nevertheless they are widely believed
to exist and hence we make the following conjecture:

>**Conjecture (The PRG conjecture):** For every $n$, there exists a pseudorandom
generator $G$ mapping $n$ bits to $n+1$ bits.^[The name "The PRG conjecture" is non-standard. In the literature this is known as the conjecture of existence of pseudorandom generators. This is a weaker form of "The Optimal PRG Conjecture" presented in my [intro to theoretical CS lecture notes](https://goo.gl/G7bU4M) since the PRG conjecture only posits the existence of pseudorandom generators with arbitrary polynomial blowup, as opposed to an exponential blowup posited in the optimal PRG conjecture.]

As was the case for the cipher conjecture, and any other conjecture, there are two natural questions
regarding the PRG conjecture: why should we believe it and why should we care. Fortunately, the answer to the first question is simple:
it is known that the cipher conjecture _implies_ the PRG conjecture, and hence if we believe the former we should believe the latter.
(The proof is highly non-trivial and we may not get to see it in this course.)
As for the second question, we will see that the PRG conjecture implies a great number of useful cryptographic tools, including the cipher conjecture (i.e., the two conjectures are in fact equivalent).
We start by showing that once we can get to an output that is one bit longer than the input, we can in fact obtain any number of bits.

> # {.theorem title="Length Extension for PRG's" #lengthextendprgthm}
Suppose that the PRG conjecture is
true. Then for every polynomial $t(n)$, there exists a pseudorandom generator
mapping $n$ bits to $t(n)$ bits.

![Length extension for pseudorandom generators](../figure/length-extension-prg.jpg){#lengthextendprgfig}


> # {.proof data-ref="lengthextendprgthm"}
The proof of this theorem is very similar to the length extension theorem for
ciphers,  and in fact this theorem can be used to give an alternative proof for the former theorem.  
>
The construction is illustrated in [lengthextendprgfig](){.ref}.
We are given a pseudorandom generator $G'$ mapping $n$ bits into $n+1$ bits and need to construct a pseudorandom generator $G$ mapping $n$ bits to $t=t(n)$
bits for some polynomial $t(\cdot)$. The idea is that we maintain a state of $n$ bits, which are originally our input seed[^seed] $s_0$, and at the $i^{th}$ step we use $G'$
to map $s_{i-1}$ to the $n+1$-long bit string $(s_i,y_i)$, output $y_i$ and keep $s_i$ as our new state.
To prove the security of this construction
we need to show that the distribution $G(U_n) = (y_1,\ldots,y_t)$  is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution $U_t$. As usual, we will use the hybrid argument.
For $i\in\{0,\ldots,t\}$ we define $H_i$ to be the distribution where the first $i$ bits chosen at uniform, whereas the last $t-i$ bits are computed as above.
Namely, we choose $s_i$ at random in $\{0,1\}^n$ and continue the computation of $y_{i+1},\ldots,y_t$ from the state $s_i$.
Clearly $H_0=G(U_n)$ and $H_t=U_t$ and hence by the triangle inequality it suffices to prove that $H_i \approx H_{i+1}$ for all $i\in\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$.
We illustrate these two hybrids in [lengthextendhybridfig](){.ref}.
>
![Hybrids $H_i$ and $H_{i+1}$--- dotted boxes refer to values that are chosen independently and uniformly at random](../figure/length-extension-prg-hybrid.jpg){#lengthextendhybridfig}
>
Now suppose otherwise, that there exists some adversary $Eve$ such that $\left| \E[Eve(H_i)] - \E[Eve(H_{i+1})] \right| \geq \epsilon$ for some non-negligible $\epsilon$.
We will build from $Eve$ an adversary $Eve'$ breaking the security of the pseudorandom generator $G'$ (see [reductionlengthextendfig](){.ref}).
>
![Building an adversary $Eve'$ for $G'$ from an adversary $Eve$ distinguishing $H_i$ and $H_{i+1}$. The boxes marked with questions marks are those that are random or pseudorandom  depending on  whether we are in $H_i$ or $H_{i+1}$. Everything inside the dashed red lines is simulated by $Eve'$ that gets as input the $n+1$-bit string $(s_{i+1},y_{i+1})$.](../figure/length-extension-prg-adversary.jpg){#reductionlengthextendfig}
>
On input of string $y$ of length $n+1$, $Eve'$ will interpret $y$ as $(s_{i+1},y_{i+1})$, choose $y_1,\ldots,y_i$ randomly and compute $y_{i+2},\ldots,y_t$ as in our pseudorandom generator's construction. $Eve'$ will then feed $(y_1,\ldots,y_t)$ to $Eve$ and output whatever $Eve$ does. Clearly, $Eve'$ is efficient if $Eve$ is. Moreover, one can see that if
$y$ was random then $Eve'$ is feeding $Eve$ with an input distributed according to $H_{i+1}$ while if $y$ was of the form $G(s)$ for a random $s$ then $Eve'$ will feed $Eve$
with an input distributed according to $H_i$. Hence we get that $| \E[ Eve'(G'(U_n))] - \E[Eve'(U_{n+1})] | \geq \epsilon$ contradicting the security of $G'$.



[^seed]:Because we use a small input to grow a large pseudorandom string, the input to a pseudorandom generator is often known as its *seed*.

The proof of [lengthextendprgthm](){.ref} is indicative of many practical constructions of pseudorandom generators. Many operating systems keep track of an initial _seed_ of randomness, and  supply a system call `rand` such that every call to `rand` applies a pseudorandom generator $G'$ to the current seed, uses part of the output to update the seed, and returns the remainder to the caller.


> # {.remark title="Unpredictability and indistinguishability- an alternative approach for proving the length extension theorem" #alternativelengthextendrem}
The notion that being random is the same as being "unpredictable" can be formalized as follows.
One can show that a random variable $X$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ is pseudorandom if and only if every efficient algorithm $A$ succeeds in the following experiment with probability at most $1/2+negl(n)$: $A$ is given $i$ chosen at random in $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_i$ where $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is drawn
from $X$ and wins if it outputs $x_{i+1}$. It is a good optional exercise to prove this, and to use that to give an alternative proof of the length extension theorem.  

## Stream ciphers

We now show a connection between our two notions:

> # {.theorem title="PRG conjecture implies  Cipher conjectures" #PRGandcipherthm}
If the PRG conjecture is true then so is the cipher conjecture.

It turns out that the converse direction is also true, and hence
these two conjectures are *equivalent*, though we will probably not show the
(quite non-trivial) proof of this fact in this course. (We might show some
weaker version of this harder direction.)


> # {.proof data-ref="PRGandcipherthm"}
The construction is actually quite simple, recall that the *one time
pad* is a perfectly secure cipher but its only problem was that to encrypt an
$n+1$ long message it needed an $n+1$ long bit key. Now using a pseudorandom
generator, we can map an $n$-bit long key into an $n+1$-bit long string that
looks random enough that we could use it as a key for the one-time pad. That is,
our cipher will look as follows:
>
$$
E_k(m) = G(k) \oplus m
$$
>
and
>
$$
D_k(c) = G(k) \oplus c
$$
>
Just like in the one time pad, $D_k(E_k(m)) = G(k) \oplus G(k) \oplus m = m$.
Moreover, the encryption and decryption algorithms are clearly efficient and so
the only thing that's left is to prove security or that for every pair $m,m'$ of plaintexts,
$E_{U_n}(m) \approx E_{U_n}(m')$. We show this by proving the following claim:
>
**Claim:** For every $m\in{\{0,1\}}^{n+1}$, $E_{U_n}(m) \approx U_{n+1} \oplus  m$.
>
The claim implies the security of the scheme, since it means that $E_{U_n}(m)$
is indistinguishable from the one-time-pad encryption of $m$, which is
identically distributed to the one-time pad encryption of $m'$ which (by another
application of the claim) is indistinguishable from $E_{U_n}(m')$ and so the
theorem follows from the triangle inequality. Thus all that's left is to prove
the claim:
>
**Proof of claim:** Suppose that there was an efficient adversary $Eve'$ such
that
>
$$
\left| {\mathbb{E}}[ Eve'(G(U_n)\oplus m)] - {\mathbb{E}}[ Eve'(U_{n+1}\oplus m) ] \right| \geq \epsilon
$$
>
for some non-negligible $\epsilon=\epsilon(n)>0$. Then the adversary $Eve$
defined as $Eve(y) = Eve'(y\oplus m)$ would be also efficient and would break
the security of the PRG with non-negligible success. This concludes the proof of the claim and hence the theorem.

If the PRG outputs $t(n)$ bits instead of $n+1$ then we automatically
get an encryption scheme with $t(n)$ long message length. In fact, in practice
if we use the length extension for PRG's, we don't need to decide on the length
of messages in advance. Every time we need to encrypt another bit (or another
block) $m_i$ of the message, we run the basic PRG to update our state and obtain
some new randomness $y_i$ that we can XOR with the message and output. Such
constructions are known as *stream ciphers* in the literature. In much
of the practical literature the name *stream cipher* is used both for the
pseudorandom generator itself, as well as for the encryption scheme that is
obtained by combining it with the one-time pad.


> # {.remark title="Using pseudorandom generators for coin tossing over the phone" #cointossingphonerm}
The following is a cute application of pseudorandom generators. Alice and Bob want to toss a fair coin over the phone. They use a pseudorandom generator $G:\{0,1\}^b\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{3n}$.
>
*  Alice will send $z\leftarrow_R\{0,1\}^{3n}$ to Bob \
* Bob picks $s\leftarrow_R\{0,1\}^n$ and with probability $1/2$ sends $G(s)$ (case I) and with probability $1/2$ sends $G(s)\oplus z$ (case II).\
* Alice then picks a random $b\leftarrow_R\{0,1\}$ and sends it to Bob. \
* Bob  reveals what he sent in the previous stage and if it was case I, their output is $b$, and if it was case II, their output is $1-b$.
>
It can be shown that (assuming the protocol is completed) the output is a random coin, which neither Alice or Bob can control or predict with more than negligible advantage over half. (Trying to formalize this and prove it is an excellent exercise.)

## What do pseudorandom generators actually look like?



So far we have made the conjectures that objects such as ciphers and
pseudorandom generators *exist*, without giving any hint as to how they would
actually look like. (Though we have  examples such as the Caesar cipher, Vignere, and Enigma of what secure ciphers _don't_ look like.)
As mentioned above, we do not know how to *prove* that
any particular function is a pseudorandom generator.
However,  there are quite simple *candidates* (i.e.,  functions that are conjectured to be secure pseudorandom generators), though care must be taken in constructing them.
We now consider candidates for functions that maps $n$ bits
to $n+1$ bits (or more generally $n+c$ for some constant $c$ ) and look at least
somewhat "randomish".
As these constructions are typically used as a basic
component for obtaining a longer length PRG via the length extension theorem ([lengthextendprgthm](){.ref}), we
will think of these pseudorandom generators as mapping a string $s\in\{0,1\}^n$
representing the current state into a string $s’\in\{0,1\}^n$ representing the new
state as well as a string $b\in\{0,1\}^c$ representing the current output. See also
Section 6.1 in Katz-Lindell and (for greater depth) Sections 3.6-3.9 in the
Boneh-Shoup book.

### Attempt 0: The counter generator

Just to get started, let's show an example of an obviously bogus pseudorandom generator.
We define  the "counter pseudorandom generator" $G:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{n+1}$ as follows.
$G(s)=(s',b)$ where $s' = s + 1 \mod 2^n$ (treating $s$ and $s'$ as numbers in $\{0,\ldots,2^n-1\}$) and $b$ is the least significant digit of $s'$.
It's a great exercise to work out why this is _not_ a secure pseudorandom generator.

> # { .pause }
You should really pause here and make sure you see why the "counter   pseudorandom generator" is not a secure pseudorandom generator. Show that this is true even if we replace the least significant digit by the $k$-th digit for every $0 \leq k < n$.


### Attempt 1: The linear checksum / linear feedback shift register (LFSR)

LFSR can be thought of as the "mother" (or maybe more like the sick great-uncle) of all psuedorandom generators.
One of the simplest ways to generate a "randomish" extra digit given an $n$ digit
number is to use a *checksum* - some linear combination of the digits, with a canonical example being the [cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) or CRC.^[CRC are often used to generate a "control digit" to detect mistypes of credit card or social security card number. This has very different goals than its use for pseudorandom generators, though there are some common intuitions behind the two usages.]
This motivates the notion of a *linear feedback shift register generator* (LFSR): if the current state is $s\in\{0,1\}^n$ then the output is $f(s)$ where $f$ is a linear function (modulo 2) and the new state is obtained by right shifting the previous state and putting $f(s)$ at the leftmost location.
That is, $s'_1 = f(s)$ and $s'_i = s_{i-1}$ for $i\in\{2,\ldots,n\}$.

LFSR's have several good properties- if the function $f(\cdot)$ is chosen properly then they can have very long _periods_
(i.e., it can take an exponential number of steps until the state repeats itself), though that also holds for the simple "counter" generator we saw above.
They also have the property that every individual bit is equal to $0$ or $1$ with probability exactly half  (the counter generator also shares this property).

A more interesting property is that  (if the function is selected properly) every two coordinates are independent from one another.
That is, there is some super-polynomial function $t(n)$ (in fact $t(n)$ can be exponential in $n$) such that if $\ell \neq \ell' \in \{0,\ldots, t(n) \}$, then if we look at the two random variables corresponding to the $\ell$-th and $\ell'$-th output of the generator (where randomness is the initial state) then they are distributed like two independent random coins. (This is non-trivial to show, and depends on the choice of $f$ - it is a challenging but useful exercise to work this out.)
The counter generator fails badly at this condition:  the least significant bits between two consecutive states always flip.

There is a more general notion of a *linear generator* where the new state can be any invertible linear transformation of the previous state. That is, we interpret the state $s$ as an element of $\Z_q^t$ for some integers $q,t$,[^Zq] and let $s’=F(s)$ and the output $b=G(s)$ where $F:\Z_q^t\rightarrow\Z_q^t$  and $G:\Z_q^t\rightarrow\Z_q$ are invertible linear transformations (modulo $q$).
This includes as a special case the *linear congruential generator* where $t=1$ and the map  $F(s)$ corresponds to taking $as \pmod{q}$ where $a$ is number co-prime to $q$.

[^Zq]: A ring is a set of elements where addition and multiplication are defined and obey the natural rules of associativity and commutativity (though without necessarily having a multiplicative inverse for every element). For every integer $q$ we define $\Z_q$ (known as the _ring of integers modulo $q$_) to be the  set $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}$ where addition and multiplication is done modulo $q$.


All these generators are unfortunately insecure due to the great bane of
cryptography- the *Gaussian elimination algorithm* which students typically encounter in any linear algebra class.^[Despite the name, the algorithm goes at least as far back as the Chinese *Jiuzhang Suanshu* manuscript, circa 150 B.C.]

> # {.theorem title="The unfortunate theorem for cryptographyhy" #gaussianelimthm}
There is a polynomial time algorithm to solve
$m$ linear equations in $n$ variables (or to certify no solution exists) over
any ring.


Despite its seeming simplicity and ubiquity, Gaussian elimination  (and some generalizations and related algorithms such as Euclid’s extended g.c.d algorithm and the LLL lattice reduction algorithm) has been used time and again to break candidate cryptographic constructions.
In particular, if we look at the first $n$ outputs of a linear  generator
$b_1,\ldots,b_n$ then we can write linear equations in the unknown initial state
of the form $f_1(s)=b_1,\ldots,f_n(s)=b_n$ where the $f_i$'s are known linear
functions.
Either those functions are *linearly independent*, in which case we
can solve the equations to get the unique solution for the original state $s$
and from which point we can predict all outputs of the generator, or they are
dependent, which means that we can predict some of the outputs even without
recovering the original state.
Either way the generator is $*\sharp !$’ed (where
$* \sharp !$ refers to whatever verb you prefer to use when your system is broken).
See also this [1977 paper](http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~jsun/random-number.pdf)
of James Reed.



> # {.remark title="Non-cryptographic PRGs" #nocryptoprgs}
The above means that it is a bad idea to use a linear checksum as a
pseudorandom generator in a cryptographic application, and in fact in any
adversarial setting (e.g., one shouldn't hope that an attacker would not be able
to reverse engineer the algorithm[^luhn] that computes the control digit of a credit card
number). However, that does not mean that there are no legitimate cases
where linear generators can be used
. In a setting where the application is not adversarial and you have an ability to *test* if the generator is actually successful, it
might be reasonable to use such insecure non-cryptographic generators.
They tend to be more efficient (though often not by much) and hence are often the default
option in many programming environments such as the `C rand()` command. (In
fact, the real bottleneck in using cryptographic pseudorandom generators is
often the generation of *entropy* for their seed, as discussed in the previous
lecture, and not their actual running time.)

[^luhn]: That number is obtained by applying an algorithm of  [Hans Peter Luhn](https://goo.gl/SL8ahM) which applies a simple map to each digit of the card and then sums them up modulo 10.


### From insecurity to security

It is often the case that we want to "fix" a broken cryptographic primitive, such as a pseudorandom generator, to make it secure.
At the moment this is still more of an art than a science, but there are some principles that cryptographers have used to try to make this more principled.
The main intuition is that there are certain properties of computational problems that make them more amenable to algorithms (i.e., "easier") and when we want to make
the problems useful for cryptography (i.e., "hard") we often seek variants that don't possess these properties. The following table illustrates some examples of such properties.
(These are not formal statements, but rather is intended to give some intuition )

Easy           Hard
-----          --------
Continuous     Discrete
Convex         Non-convex
Linear         Non-linear (degree $\geq 2$)
Noiseless      Noisy
Local          Global
Shallow        Deep
Low degree     High degree


Many cryptographic constructions can be thought of as trying to transform an easy problem into a hard one by moving from the left to the right column of this table.

The **discrete logarithm problem** is the discrete version of the continuous real logarithm problem.
The **learning with errors problem** can be thought of as the noisy version of the linear equations problem (or the discrete version of least squares minimization).
When constructing **block ciphers** we often have _mixing_ transformation to ensure that the dependency structure between different bits is _global_, _S-boxes_ to ensure _non-linearity_, and many _rounds_ to ensure _deep_ structure and _large algebraic degree_.

This also works in the other direction.
Many algorithmic and machine learning advances work by embedding a discrete problem in a continuous convex one.
Some attacks on cryptographic objects can be thought of as  trying to recover some of the structure (e.g., by embedding modular arithmetic in the real line or "linearizing" non linear equations).




### Attempt 2: Linear Congruential Generators with dropped bits

One  approach that is widely used in implementations of  pseudorandom generators is to take a linear generator such as the
linear congruential generators described above, and use for the output a "chopped" version of the linear function and drop some of the
least significant bits. The operation of dropping these bits is non-linear and hence the attack above does not immediately apply.
Nevertheless, it turns out this attack can be generalized to handle this case, and hence even with dropped bits Linear Congruential Generators are completely insecure
and should be used (if at all) only in applications such as simulations where there is no adversary.
Section 3.7.1 in the Boneh-Shoup book describes one attack against such generators that uses the notion of
_lattice algorithms_ that we will encounter later in this course in very different contexts.

##  Successful examples

Let's now describe some _successful_ (at least per current knowledge) pseudorandom generators:


### Case Study 1: Subset Sum Generator

Here is an extremely simple generator that is yet still secure[^ss_sec] as far as we know.

[^ss_sec]: Actually modern computers will be able to break this generator via brute force, but if the length and number of the constants were doubled (or perhaps  quadrupled) this should be sufficiently secure, though longer to write down.

```python
# seed is a list of 40 zero/one  values
# output is a 48 bit integer
def subset_sum_gen(seed):
  modulo = 0x1000000
  constants = [  
     0x3D6EA1, 0x1E2795, 0xC802C6, 0xBF742A, 0x45FF31,  
     0x53A9D4, 0x927F9F, 0x70E09D, 0x56F00A, 0x78B494,  
     0x9122E7, 0xAFB10C, 0x18C2C8, 0x8FF050, 0x0239A3,  
     0x02E4E0, 0x779B76, 0x1C4FC2, 0x7C5150, 0x81E05E,  
     0x154647, 0xB80E68, 0xA042E5, 0xE20269, 0xD3B7F3,  
     0xCC5FB9, 0x0BFC55, 0x847AE0, 0x8CFDF8, 0xE304B7,
     0x869ACE, 0xB4CDAB, 0xC8E31F, 0x00EDC7, 0xC50541,  
     0x0D6DDD, 0x695A2F, 0xA81062, 0x0123CA, 0xC6C5C3 ]

  # return the modular sum of the constants
  # corresponding to ones in the seed
  return reduce(lambda x,y: (x+y) % modulo,
                map(lambda a,b: a*b, constants,seed))
```

The seed to this generator is an array `seed` of 40 bits, with 40 hardwired constants each 48 bits long (these constants were generated at random, but are fixed once and for all, and are not kept secret and hence are not
considered part of the secret random seed).
The output is simply
$$\sum_{i=1}^{40} \texttt{seed}[i]\texttt{constants}[i] \pmod{2^{48}}$$
and hence expands the $40$ bit input into a $48$ bit output.


This generator is loosely motivated by the "subset sum" computational problem, which is NP hard. However, since NP hardness is a _worst case_ notion of complexity, it does not imply security for pseudorandom generators, which requires hardness of an _average case_ variant.
To get some intuition for its security, we can work out why (given that it seems to be linear) we cannot break it by simply using Gaussian elimination.

This is an excellent point for you to stop and try to answer this question on your own.

Given the known constants and known output,  figuring out the set of potential seeds can be thought of as solving a _single_ equation in 40 variables.
However, this equation is clearly overdetermined, and will have a solution regardless of whether the observed value is indeed an output of the generator, or it is chosen uniformly at random.

More concretely,  we can use linear-equation solving to  compute (given the known constants $c_1,\ldots,c_{40} \in \Z_{2^{48}}$ and the output $y \in \Z_{2^{48}}$) the linear subspace $V$ of all vectors $(s_1,\ldots,s_{40}) \in (\Z_{2^{48}})^{40}$ such that $\sum s_i c_i = y \pmod{2^{48}}$.
But, regardless of whether $y$ was generated at random from $\Z_{2^{48}}$, or $y$ was generated as an output of the generator, the subspace $V$ will always have the same dimension (specifically, since it is formed by a single linear equation over $40$ variables, the dimension will be $39$.)
To break the generator we seem to need to be able to decide whether this linear subspace $V \subseteq (\Z_{2^{48}})^{40}$ contains a _Boolean vector_ (i.e., a vector $s\in \{0,1\}^n$).
Since the condition that a vector is Boolean is not defined by linear equations, we cannot use Gaussian elimination to break the generator.
Generally, the task of finding a vector with _small_ coefficients inside a discrete linear subspace is closely related to a classical problem known as finding the [shortest vector in a lattice](https://goo.gl/WRNT9S). (See also the [short integer solution (SIS) problem](https://goo.gl/KwZWhV).)



### Case Study 2: RC4

The following is another example of an extremely simple generator known as RC4 (this stands for Rivest Cipher 4, as Ron Rivest invented this in 1987) and is still fairly widely used today.

```python
def RC4(P,i,j):
    i = (i + 1) % 256
    j = (j + P[i]) % 256
    P[i], P[j] = P[j], P[i]
    return (P,i,j,P[(P[i]+P[j]) % 256])
```

The function `RC4` takes as input the current state `P,i,j` of the generator and returns the new state together with a single output byte.
The state of the generator consists of an array `P` of 256 bytes, which can be thought of as a  _permutation_ of the numbers $0,\ldots,255$ in the sense that we maintain the invariant that
$\texttt{P}[i]\neq\texttt{P}[j]$ for every $i\neq j$, and two indices $i,j \in \{0,\ldots,255\}$.
We can consider the initial state as the case where `P` is a completely random permutation and $i$ and $j$ are initialized to zero, although to save on initial seed size, typically RC4 uses some "pseudorandom" way to generate `P` from a shorter seed as well.

RC4 has extremely efficient software implementations and hence has been widely implemented. However, it has several issues with its security. In particular it was shown by Mantin[^fn] and Shamir that the second bit of RC4 is _not_ random, even if the initialization vector was random.
This and other issues led to a practical attack on the 802.11b WiFi protocol, see Section 9.9 in Boneh-Shoup.
The initial response to those attacks was to suggest to drop the first 1024 bytes of the output, but by now the attacks have been sufficiently extended that RC4 is simply not considered a secure cipher anymore.
The ciphers Salsa and ChaCha, designed by Dan Bernstein, have a similar design to RC4, and are considered secure and deployed in several standard protocols such as TLS, SSH and QUIC, see Section 3.6 in Boneh-Shoup.

## Non-constructive existence of pseudorandom generators

We now show that, if we don't insist on _constructivity_ of pseudorandom generators, then we can show that there exists  pseudorandom generators with output that  _exponentially larger_   in the input length.


> # {.lemma title="Existence of inefficient pseudorandom generators" #prgexist}
There is some absolute constant $C$ such that for every $\epsilon,T$, if $\ell > C (\log T + \log (1/\epsilon))$ and $m \leq T$,  then there is an $(T,\epsilon)$ pseudorandom generator $G: \{0,1\}^\ell \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$.


> # {.proofidea data-ref="prgexist"}
The proof uses an extremely useful technique known  as the "probabilistic method" which is not too hard mathematically but can be confusing at first.^[There is a whole (highly recommended) [book by Alon and Spencer](https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Method-Discrete-Mathematics-Optimization/dp/1119061954/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)  devoted to this method.]
The idea is to give a "non constructive" proof of existence of the pseudorandom generator $G$ by showing that if $G$ was chosen at random, then the probability that it would be a valid $(T,\epsilon)$ pseudorandom generator is positive.
In  particular this means that there _exists_ a single $G$ that is a valid $(T,\epsilon)$ pseudorandom generator.
The probabilistic method is just a _proof technique_ to demonstrate the existence of such a function.
Ultimately, our goal is to show the existence of  a _deterministic_ function $G$ that satisfies
the conditions of a $(T, \epsilon)$ PRG.

The above discussion might be rather abstract at this point, but would become clearer after seeing the proof.



> # {.proof data-ref="prgexist"}
Let $\epsilon,T,\ell,m$ be as in the lemma's statement. We need to show that there exists a function $G:\{0,1\}^\ell \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ that "fools" every $T$ line program $P$ in the sense of [prgdefeq](){.eqref}.
We will show that this follows from the following claim:
>
__Claim I:__ For every fixed NAND program / Boolean circuit $P$, if we pick $G:\{0,1\}^\ell \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ _at random_ then the probability that [prgdefeq](){.eqref} is violated is at most $2^{-T^2}$.
>
Before proving Claim I, let us see why it implies [prgexist](){.ref}.
We can identify a function $G:\{0,1\}^\ell \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ with its "truth table" or simply the list of evaluations on all its possible $2^\ell$ inputs. Since each output is an $m$ bit string,
we can also think of $G$ as a string in $\{0,1\}^{m\cdot 2^\ell}$. We define $\mathcal{G}^m_\ell$ to be the set of all functions from $\{0,1\}^\ell$ to $\{0,1\}^\ell$. As discussed above we can identify $\mathcal{F}_\ell^m$ with $\{0,1\}^{m\cdot 2^\ell}$ and choosing a random function $G \sim \mathcal{F}_\ell^m$ corresponds to choosing a random $m\cdot 2^\ell$-long bit string.
>
For every NAND program / Boolean circuit  $P$ let $B_P$ be the event that, if we choose $G$ at random from $\mathcal{F}_\ell^m$ then  [prgdefeq](){.eqref} is violated with respect to the program $P$.
It is important to understand what is the sample space that the event $B_P$ is defined over, namely this event depends on the choice of $G$ and so $B_P$ is a subset of $\mathcal{F}_\ell^m$. An equivalent way to define the  event $B_P$ is that it is the subset of  all functions  mapping $\{0,1\}^\ell$ to $\{0,1\}^m$  that violate [prgdefeq](){.eqref}, or in other words:
$$
B_P = \left\{ G \in \mathcal{F}_\ell^m  \; \big| \; \left| \tfrac{1}{2^\ell}\sum_{s\in \{0,1\}^\ell} P(G(s)) - \tfrac{1}{2^m}\sum_{r \in \{0,1\}^m}P(r)  \right| > \epsilon  \right\} \;\;. \label{eq:eventdefine}
$$
(We've replaced here the probability statements in [prgdefeq](){.eqref} with the equivalent sums so as to reduce confusion as to what is the sample space that $B_P$ is defined over.)
>
To understand this proof it is crucial that you pause here and see how  the definition of $B_P$ above corresponds to [eq:eventdefine](){.eqref}. This may well take re-reading the above text once or twice, but it is a good exercise at parsing probabilistic statements and learning how to identify the _sample space_ that these statements correspond to.
>
Now, the number of programs of size $T$ (or circuits of size $T$) is at most $2^{O(T\log T)}$.
Since $T\log T = o(T^2$)  this means that if  Claim I  is true, then by the union bound it holds that the probability of the union of $B_P$ over _all_ NAND programs of at most $T$ lines is at most $2^{O(T\log T)}2^{-T^2} < 0.1$ for sufficiently large $T$.
What is important for us about the number $0.1$ is that it is smaller than $1$.
In particular this means that there _exists_ a single $G^* \in \mathcal{F}_\ell^m$ such that $G^*$ _does not_ violate [prgdefeq](){.eqref} with respect to any NAND program of at most $T$ lines, but that precisely means that $G^*$ is a $(T,\epsilon)$ pseudorandom generator.
>
Hence  conclude the proof of [prgexist](){.ref}, it suffices to prove Claim I.
Choosing a random $G: \{0,1\}^\ell \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ amounts to choosing $L=2^\ell$ random strings $y_0,\ldots,y_{L-1} \in \{0,1\}^m$ and letting $G(x)=y_x$ (identifying $\{0,1\}^\ell$ and $[L]$ via the binary representation).
Hence the claim amounts to showing that for every fixed function $P:\{0,1\}^m \rightarrow \{0,1\}$,
if $L >  2^{C (\log T + \log \epsilon)}$ (which by setting $C>4$, we can ensure is larger than $10 T^2/\epsilon^2$) then the probability that
$$
\left| \tfrac{1}{L}\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} P(y_s)  -  \Pr_{s \sim \{0,1\}^m}[P(s)=1] \right| > \epsilon \label{prgdefeqchernoff}
$$
is at most $2^{-T^2}$.
[{prgdefeqchernoff}](){.eqref} follows directly from the Chernoff bound.
If we let for every $i\in  [L]$  the random variable $X_i$ denote $P(y_i)$, then since $y_0,\ldots,y_{L-1}$ is chosen independently at random, these are independently and identically distributed random variables with mean $\E_{y \sim \{0,1\}^m}[P(y)]= \Pr_{y\sim \{0,1\}^m}[ P(y)=1]$ and hence the probability that they deviate from their expectation by $\epsilon$ is at most $2\cdot 2^{-\epsilon^2 L/2}$.
